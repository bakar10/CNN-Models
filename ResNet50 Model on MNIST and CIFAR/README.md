# Multi-Dataset Image Classification with ResNet50

This repository contains code for multi-dataset image classification using the ResNet50 model as a feature extractor. The ResNet50 model is fine-tuned and trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets for image classification tasks.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Contents

1. **MNIST and CIFAR-10 Classification with ResNet50**:
    - Code for loading and preprocessing MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
    - Fine-tuning the ResNet50 model for image classification.
    - Evaluating model performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

## Usage

To use the code:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

    ```bash
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

3. Run the Python script to train and evaluate the ResNet50 model on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
